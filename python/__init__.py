"""Fast and exact spin-s spherical-harmonic transforms

This module contains functions for manipulating spin-weighted spherical harmonics, which are
essentially generalizations of the usual spherical harmonics, but with certain vectorial or
tensorial qualities.  For a full discussion of spin-weighted spherical functions see this paper:
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08140>.

This code is a lightly modified version of the code created by Huffenberger, based on work by
Huffenberger and Wandelt <http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/189/2/255/meta>.

For examples, see here: <https://github.com/moble/spinsfast/blob/master/example/spinsfast.ipynb>.

    Parameters
    ----------
    salm : array_like, complex, shape (..., (lmax+1)**2)
        Input array representing mode weights of the spin-weighted function.  This array may be
        multi-dimensional, where initial dimensions may represent different times, for example, or
        separate functions on the sphere.  The final dimension should give the values of the mode
        weights, in the order described below in the 'Notes' section.
    s : int or array, int, shape (...)
        Spin weight of the function.  If `salm` is multidimensional and this is an array, its
        dimensions must match the first dimensions of `salm`, and the different values are the spin
        weights of the different functions represented by those dimensions.  Otherwise, if `salm` is
        multidimensional and `s` is a single integer, all functions are assumed to have the same
        spin weight.
    lmax : int
        The largest `ell` value present in the input array.
    Ntheta : int
        Number of points in the output grid along the polar angle.
    Nphi : int
        Number of points in the output grid along the azimuthal angle.


    Returns
    -------
    map : ndarray, complex, shape (..., Ntheta, Nphi)
        Values of the spin-weighted function on grid points of the sphere.  This array is shaped
        like the input `salm` array, but has one extra dimension.  The final two dimensions describe
        the values of the function on the sphere.

    --------
    spinsfast.map2salm : Roughly the inverse of this function.


    Notes
    -----

    The input `salm` data should be given in increasing order of `ell` value, always starting with
    (ell, m) = (0, 0) even if `s` is nonzero, proceeding to (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), etc.
    Explicitly, the ordering should match this:

        [f_lm(ell, m) for ell in range(lmax+1) for m in range(-ell, ell+1)]

    The input is converted to a contiguous complex numpy array if necessary.

    The output data are presented on this grid of spherical coordinates:

        np.array([[f(theta, phi)
                   for phi in np.linspace(0.0, 2*np.pi, num=2*lmax+1, endpoint=False)]
                  for theta in np.linspace(0.0, np.pi, num=2*lmax+1, endpoint=True)])

    Note that `map2salm` and `salm2map` are not true inverses of each other for several reasons.
    First, modes with `ell < |s|` should always be zero; they are simply assumed to be zero on input
    to `salm2map`.  It is also possible to define a `map` function that violates this assumption --
    for example, having a nonzero average value over the sphere, if the function has nonzero spin
    `s`, this is impossible.  Also, it is possible to define a map of a function with so much
    angular dependence that it cannot be captured with the given `lmax` value.  For example, a
    discontinuous function will never be perfectly resolved.


    Example
    -------
    >>> s = -2
    >>> lmax = 8
    >>> Ntheta = Nphi = 2*lmax + 1
    >>> modes = np.zeros(spinsfast.N_lm(lmax), dtype=np.complex128)
    >>> modes[spinsfast.lm_ind(2, 2, 8)] = 1.0
    >>> values = spinsfast.salm2map(modes, s, lmax, Ntheta, Nphi)
